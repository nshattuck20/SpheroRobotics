This repository contains JavaScript code examples and challenge exercise solutions for the SpheroEdu Premiere Robotics course. Each JavaScript file corresponds to an individual module, for example "module_20" corresponds to code from module 20, which contains code for students to use to supplement their learning. This code was written during the summer 2021 ETS/TRIO summer robotics program.
